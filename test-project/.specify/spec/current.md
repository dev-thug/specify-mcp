# Project Specification

## Users
Primary users are individual developers who manage multiple projects simultaneously. They need a way to quickly switch between tasks without losing context.

## Problem Statement
Developers often lose track of what they were working on when switching between projects. This leads to:
- Wasted time trying to remember context
- Important tasks being forgotten
- Difficulty prioritizing work across projects

## Functional Requirements
The system must:
- Support multiple project workspaces
- Allow task prioritization (High/Medium/Low)
- Track task status (Todo/In Progress/Done)
- Provide quick task switching capabilities
- Maintain context for each project

## Success Criteria
- 50% reduction in context-switching time
- 90% task completion rate
- Under 2 seconds to find any task
